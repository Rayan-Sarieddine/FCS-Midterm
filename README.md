# Employee Database System
The following Python script will provide a way of managing an employee database system where there are 2 types of users: Admin and normal users(employees).
The employees will have the ability to view their salary on this system after logging in.
The admin has the following controls:
Displaying Statistics about employees (gender), Adding an Employee, Displaying all Employees, Changing Employee’s Salary, Removing an Employee and Raising an Employee’s Salary.
Each user log-in and log-out time will be registered on a seperate text file with their own ID ad a name.
An updated sheet of employees will be generated after each admin change of the database information.
